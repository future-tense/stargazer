## Security

All private keys are stored in localStorage, encrypted or not. Within the app, key decryption and transaction signing all take place inside the `Keychain` service in `app/core/services/keychain.js`. The only time an unencrypted private key leaves that service is when an account is being exported and you're not using password protection.

All transactions go through the same steps of being displayed for review before being signed and submitted.

*NB: Some of the phrases contains placeholders, e.g. `{{key}}`, where the placeholder `key` mustn't be translated.
Some of the phrases, specifically the `XX days/hours/minutes/seconds ago` ones, have both a singular and a plurar form that should be translated.*
